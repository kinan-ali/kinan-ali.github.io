							<p>1. The first step included mechanicaly modifying a Stewart Platfrom.</p>

								  <img src="images/Im_stewart2.jpg" alt="Stewart Platform Setup2" style="width:100%;">
								</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							<p>This involved using more powerful motors and longer arms to expand the workspace of the robot</p>
							<table style="width:100%; margin-top: 0em;">

									<img src="images/Im_stewart5.jpg" alt="Stewart Platform Setup5" style="width: 75%;">
								</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>
							
							<p>The workspace study was performed using Matlab SIMULINK</p>
							<img src="images/Im_stewart_workspace.svg" style="width: 80%;">
							<p>2. The second task was creating a measurement system. A cheap and effective one!</p>
							<p>the first attempt involved using a webcam and two Aruco markers (one for the moving platfrom and the 
							and the other is for the reference base) with an OpenCV code</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_stewart_camera1.gif" alt="Stewart Platfrom Camera1" style="width: 50%;">
							<p>The errors were large due to the bad camera specifications!</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_stewart_camera2.png" alt="Stewart Platfrom Camera2" style="width: 50%;">
							<p>As a solution for this, Mobile phone camera was used and linked to the computer through wirless network<br />
							in addition, the Aruco markers were replaced with a single Aruco board. Perspective-N-Point algorithm was
							used to estimate the position and orientation of the moving platfrom. The base location was estimated with a calibration
							process at the start of the movement... <br />
							In short: use better tools, increase the points that you use for each estimation, you get more stable readings!</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_stewart_camera3.png" alt="Stewart Platfrom Camera2" style="width: 50%;">
							
							<p>At each point of the project, the GUI (created with python) was modified to have more functionality, and look COOLER!
							<img src = "images/Im_stewart_gui.png" alt="Stewart Platfrom GUI" style="width: 100%;">
							
							<p>Now that everything is set. A platfrom, measurments, and a GUI. Then project starts! Now, we can dive into Control Systems!.
							<p>But first!, it's important to have fun. Maybe make the platfrom play ping pong!.

							<p>The task involved investigating machine learning methods to control a robot.</p>
							<p>1. first, it's important to theoretically study the platfrom, including reference framese,
							Inverse Geometric Model, and Inverse Kinematic Model of the platfrom.</p>
							<img src="images/Im_3RRR_PPM.jpg" alt="Stewart Platfrom Camera2" style="width: 100%;">
							<p>This is important to identify singularities and get a picture of the workspace.
							<p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_singularities.jpg" alt = "" style ="width:100%;">
							<p>With the right equations (and of course Matlab) we can easily draw a map of the workspace.</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_map.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;">
							
							<p>For the Control part, three algorithms were implemented and compared. Two of which are basic traditional methods.</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_control1.jpg" alt = "" style="width:80%;">
							
							<p>Considering machine learning, A dataset was collected by randomly moving the arms of the robot and tracking 
							the changes in the end-effector's pose. This is repeated at different locations in the workspcae in a random walk process(for generlization)</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_data.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%;">
							<p>After collecting the data, it's time to build our Neural Network Controller. 
							It's easy to think that the inputs of the controller should be the required change in the end-effector's pose. To say...
							The purpose is to map the required change in task space to the corresponding change in joint space. HOWEVER,
							because of the nonlinearity of the platfrom, this change may differ from location to another in the workspace. 
							Adding the current pose of the end-effector to the inputs should handle that.</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_control2.jpg" alt = "" style="width:80%;">
							<p>Hyperparameter tuning (through a random search) was emplyed to optimize the networks's performance.</p>
							<p>Experiemental steup: <br/>
							Three KL17H248 stepper motors with maximum torques of 0.54 Nm drive the active joints
							in 1/8 working mode (each step is equivalent to 1.8(deg)/8=0.225(deg). 
							three A4988 drivers connected to Arduino Uno through a CNC shield are 
							used to drive the three motors. A computer endowed with a 2.20 GHz 
							Intel Core (TM) Quad processor performs image acquisition and processing 
							using a Creative Webcam camera (30 fps) connected to the computer. 
							The implementation of the different algorithms along with image processing 
							was accomplished through a python code using OpenCv library which allows for 
							the detection of the Aruco marker placed on the top of the end-effector. The 
							computer acquires frames from the camera, connected to it, employing the
							OpenCV library. These frames are then subjected to a detection algorithm 
							designed to identify the position and orientation of the end-effector. The 
							detected pose of the end-effector is then converted from image reference frame 
							to the platform reference frame using a linear transformation which is defined 
							through a calibration process. </p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_gui.png" alt="3RRR PPM gui" style = "width:100%;">	
							<p>A mumber of  trajectories were used to evaluate the performance</p>
							<img src = "images/Im_3RRR_PPM_result.png" alt="3RRR PPM result1" style="width:80%;">
							<p>Lesson learnt: Machine learning methods in control can achieve similar results to 
							traditional techniques... Of course after all it's all about how you design a control system.
							Nevertheless, traditional methods require a model to work... a mathematical model that depends
							on the measurments of parameters (like length and mass). measurments' errors can affect the performance though
							in model-based methods. While data-driven approaches depend on REAL data that is collected from the REAL Platfrom
							with all the noise included. Collecting the data, and building a model, is a different way of control.</p>
							
							<p>This project was Research opportunity as it rised many questions!. Although data-driven methods show 
							promising experiemental results, How can we ENSURE they work all the time?! a proven mathematical guarantee?!
							this  question led me to delve into advanecd research like Contraction theory, a topic of onother time. <br/>
							Another question would be related to the dataset. The neural-network's performance is directly affected by
							the quality of the collected data. Shouldn't we find a method that ensures data quality? At least in parallel
							manipulators... This question was further discussed in another project.

									<h2><a style="font-size: 0.6em;">FlyBack DC-DC converter design</a></h2>
									<p>A power electronics workshop at HIAST aimed to design a flyback converter. 
									A project that was painful, yet entertaining.</p>
								<!-- Hidden Section-->
								  <div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
								  
									<p>Like most things, it started with Matlab and textbooks. A good begining is to 
									have a clear picture of the converter. How does work? In addition, what mode should it work in?
									Discontinuous Current Mode (DCM) or Continuous (CCM)?</p>
									<img src = "images/Im_flyback_matlab.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;">
									<p>Dicontinuous mode was selected. It's beacause we can find a linear relation between the input 
									and the output voltage (with some neglections), which makes the Control much easier. 
									Additionally, the maximum primary current is lower compared to CCM.
									</p>
									
									<p>When it comes to power electronics, Matlab is not enough. It's good to start
									with Matlab to get a bigger picture of the design and perform a basic simulation...
									However, a more useful tool would PsPice, which was used for the full design and 
									simulation of the circuit. </p>
									<img src="images/Im_flyback_pspice1.jpg" alt="" style="width:70%;">
									<img src="images/Im_flyback_pspice.jpg" alt="" style="width:70%;">
									<p>In the design process is important to choose electronic parts that endure the 
									applied voltage and current (with a safty margin) but also with limit... The better the 
									specifications the more expensive it gets.</p>
